## meta-raspberrypi
------------------
- Hardware specific BSP overlay for the RaspberryPi device.
- The core BSP part of meta-raspberrypi should work with different OpenEmbedded/Yocto distributions and layer
stacks, such as:
	• Distro-less (only with OE-Core).
	• Angstrom.
	• Yocto/Poky

## Hardware Supported
--------------------
- Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Zero
- Raspberry Zero Wireless

- Link: 
```
git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
```
## Dependencies
----------------
- URI 	: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
- Layers	: meta-oe, meta-multimedia, meta-networking, meta-python

## Steps to generate an Yocto Image for Raspberry Pi3
--------------------------------------------------
- Poky has no support for Broadcom BCM SoC.
- Step1: Download the BSP Layer for Raspberry Pi3
```
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
```
- Step2: Download meta-openembedded branch as meta-raspberrypi layer depends upon it
```
$ git clone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
```
- Step3: Once you complete cloning, there should be three folders: poky, meta-openembedded, meta-raspberrypi
```
$ ls source
```
- Step4: Run the environment script to setup the Yocto Environment and create build directory
```
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env build_pi
```
- Step5: Add meta-openembedded layers ( meta-oe, meta-multimedia, meta-networking, meta-python) and meta-raspberrypi layer to bblayers.conf
- Step6: Set the MACHINE in local.conf to "raspberrypi3".
```
$ echo 'MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"' >> conf/local.conf
```
- Step7: Final step is to build the image. To find out the available images:
```
$ ls ../meta-raspberrypi/recipes-*/images/
```

## Images
------------
- rpi-hwup-image.bb: This is an image based on core-image-minimal
- rpi-basic-image.bb: This is an image based on rpi-hwup-image.bb, with some added features (a splash screen)
- rpi-test-image.bb: This is an image based on rpi-basic-image.bb, which includes some packages present in meta-raspberrypi

## Enabling UART
--------------
- RaspberryPi 3 does not have the UART enabled by default because this needs a fixed core frequency and enable_uart wil set it to the minimum
- To enable it, set the following in local.conf
```
ENABLE_UART = "1"
```
```
$ bitbake rpi-hwup-image
```

## Booting Process in Raspberry Pi3
---------------------------------
- Broadcom BCM2837:
	- CPU 	-	1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 Cortex-A53
	- GPU 	-	Broadcom VideoCore IV
	- SDRAM	-	1024 MiB

### When you power the device
Stage 1 Booting - OnChip ROM
----------------------------
- GPU - On, CPU - Off, SDRAM - Off
- When the Pi is powered up the first thing that starts working is the GPU core and ARM CPU is held in reset
- The GPU core is the main part responsible for the first booting steps of the Pi. 
- Inside Broadcom’s SoC, there is a small boot ROM, its programmed by default to look for a file called
	bootcode.bin on the SD Card
- It loads bootcode.bin into L2 Cache memory		

Stage 2 Booting - bootcode.bin
------------------------------
- GPU - On, CPU - Off, SDRAM - On
- Executed on VideoCore GPU
- Enables SDRAM
- Loads the third stage bootloader start.elf into SDRAM

Stage 3 Booting - start.elf
----------------------------
- GPU - On, CPU - On, SDRAM - On
- start.elf is actually a full fledge proprietary operating system for GPU known as VCOS (VideoCore OS).
- It starts by reading config.txt  which contains configuration parameters for
- VideoCore (Video/HDMI modes, memory, console frame buffers etc) and
	- Linux Kernel (load addresses, device tree, uart/console baud rates etc)
	- kernel = kernel7.img
- It also loads a file cmdline.txt if it exists, and will pass its contents as kernel command line
- Finally enables the ARM CPU and loads the kernel image which is executed on the ARM CPU
- It also loads the dtb file

## Booting in Raspberry Pi3
---------------------------
- GPU Core
- first stage bootloader, which is stored in ROM on the SoC
- bootcode.bin
- start.elf
- config.txt
- cmdline.txt
- kernel7.img

## Flashing images on SD Card
-----------------------------
- Images are present in tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3
```
$ lsblk

$ sudo dd if=rpi-hwup-image-raspberrypi3.rpi-sdimg of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 && sync
```

## Hardware setup
================
- An SD card with image flashed
- Raspberry Pi 3
- A power adapter that can supply 5V
- USB TTL-2303(PL2303) for serial communication
- USB-TTL is connected to the J8 connector of Raspberry Pi3 in the following formation:

| J8 Pin | USB-TTL Function |
|---------|------------------|
| 6       | GND (Ground)     |
| 8       | RXL              |
| 10      | TXL              |
## Raspberry Pi Zero W and Yocto
------------------------------
- 1GHz, Single-core CPU
- 512MB RAM
- Mini HDMI and USB On-The-Go ports
- Micro USB power
- HAT-compatible 40-pin header
- Composite video and reset headers
-	CSI camera connector
-	802.11n wireless LAN
-	Bluetooth 4.0

## Steps for generating Yocto Image
----------------------------------
- Everything is same except MACHINE = 'raspberrypi0-wifi'

## Remotely access raspberry pi3
===============================
```
$ bitbake rpi-basic-image
```
- dropbear is a SSH 2 server designed to be small enough to be used in small memory environments

## IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE
------------------------
- Adds extra free space to the root filesystem image.
- The variable specifies the value in kilobytes
- Default value : 0
- For example, to add an additional 4 GB of space, set the variable to IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "4194304"
